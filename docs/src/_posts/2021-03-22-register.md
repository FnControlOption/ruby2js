Originally, CoffeeScript had a
[coffeescript/register](https://coffeescript.org/#nodejs-usage) module, which
would automatically compile CoffeeScript files on the fly.

Originally, Babel later adopted it, producing the
[@babel/register](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-register/) module, which
will automatically compile `.es6`, `.es`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, and `.js` files the
fly.

Now, Ruby2JS has adopted the idea, and in fact uses the
[same hook](https://github.com/ariporad/pirates#readme), and makes available
the [@ruby2js/register](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ruby2js/register)
module, which will automatically compile `.rb` files on the fly.

## Demonstration

Let's start with the simple and somewhat canonical greet function in Ruby:

```ruby
# greet.rb
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello #{name}!"
end
```

Now add a main program, in JavaScript, which registers and configures Ruby2JS,
and then calls out to the above script:

```javascript
// main.js
require('@ruby2js/register')({
  options: {
    eslevel: 2021,
    autoexports: 'default',
    filters: ['cjs', 'functions']
  }
})

const greet = require('./greet')

greet('World')
```

All that's left is to install the module and go:

```sh
yarn add @ruby2js/register
node main.js
```

Enjoy!
