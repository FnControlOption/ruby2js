Usage of Ruby2JS in the wild:

* **[Ruby2JS](https://ruby2js.com/examples)** - the interactivity of this very
  site is achieved with a small number of
  [Stimulus controllers](https://github.com/ruby2js/ruby2js/tree/master/demo/controllers)
  that communicate with each other by subclassing a
  [DemoController](https://github.com/ruby2js/ruby2js/blob/master/demo/livedemo.js.rb)
  superclass.
* **[Crystallized](https://github.com/whitefusionhq/crystallized)** – a collection of controller plugins for Lit 2 which offer useful enhancements inspired by Stimulus.
* **Apache Whimsy** – a collection of useful organizational tools used by the ASF and Apache committers to access and manipulate data about Apache people, projects, and processes.
