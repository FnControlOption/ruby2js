The **React** filter enables you to build [React](https://reactjs.org/) components.

The examples below are based on the examples from the
[React](https://reactjs.org/) website.  For best results:

 * Bring up the [React](https://reactjs.org/) website and this page side by
   side.  Compare the JavaScript and Ruby sources for each example.

 * Download and run the
   [demo](https://github.com/ruby2js/ruby2js/tree/master/demo/reactjs.org#readme).
   Feel free to make changes and see the results live.

 * View source on the demo pages that you are serving locally.  Go back to
   [React](https://reactjs.org/) and uncheck the _JSX?_ checkbox in the top
   right of the corresponding example.  Compare the sources

## Examples

As you go through these examples, you will see that there are multiple ways
to do this (for example, three ways to express HTML, two ways to access
state).  This enables you to chose to adopt a more JavaScript/JSX style or
a more Ruby/Markaby/builder style.  Feel free to mix and match the various
approaches, even within the scope of a single method.
