## Where to get support

* Start by reading the [Ruby2JS Documentation](/docs/).
* Kick off a discussion on the [Discussions Board on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/discussions).

There are a bunch of helpful core team and community members available that should be able to point you in the right direction.

## Ways to contribute

Whether you're a developer, designer, or overall Ruby2JS enthusiast, there are lots of ways to contribute. Here's a few ideas:

* Comment on some of the project's [open issues](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/issues). Have you experienced the same problem? Know a work around? Do you have a suggestion for how the feature could be better?
* Read through the [documentation](/docs/) and file a pull request (PR) by forking the [Ruby2JS repo on GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/fork) and adding your changes or suggestions for something that could be improved.
* Browse through the latest [discussions](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/discussions) and lend a hand answering questions or proposing awesome new features. There's a good chance other folks are in the same boat as you.
* Help evaluate [open pull requests](https://github.com/{{ site.metadata.github }}/pulls) by testing the changes locally and reviewing what's proposed. Or if you have a PR you'd like to submit for a new feature or a bugfix, we'd be thrilled to evaluate it and guide it through the release cycle.
